**Objectives** 
In this lab, you will be creating a data structure to help you search through data. You will create binary search trees to store data about employees in a company. The user will enter commands into the database to insert data of employees customers, search through IDs and ages and autocomplete names. 

**Problem Statement**
This assignment wants you to search efficiently in a database of employees. Instead of storing data in a list or an array, we create binary search trees to store the data and help us search quickly through it.
