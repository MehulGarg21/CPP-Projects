**Objectives**
In this lab, you will be creating a computer simulation of a queue management system for a grocery store. The simulation will imitate customers, checkout registers and queues on checkout registers in a grocery store. The user will enter commands into the simulation to create customers, open and close checkout registers. Registers and customers will be added to queues implemented using linked list data structures. You will simulate customers in a “single” queue and in “multiple” queues.


**Problem Statement**
This assignment wants you to simulate different queue management strategies in a grocery store. Instead of testing out different queue management strategies in a real grocery store, we will build a computer simulation to test out different strategies.
