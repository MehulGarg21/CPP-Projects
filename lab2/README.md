**Objective**
The main objective of this assignment is to introduce you to the use of classes, objects, and methods, thus applying the related concepts presented in the lectures. You will do so by building a Pong game. You will first implement two classes that represent the player and a ball in the game. You will then implement the main function that runs the game loop.


**Pong Game**
In this lab, you will implement the Pong Game with a single player controlling a paddle to hit incoming balls. The player moves the paddle up or down to prevent the balls from hitting the wall behind them. Each successful hit increases the player's score by 1. If the player misses a ball, the game is over. As the score increases, the paddle size decreases, and the number of balls increases, making the game progressively harder.
