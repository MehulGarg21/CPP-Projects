**Objectives**
The objectives of this assignment are for you to practice: (1) the use of C++ I/O streams, including error handling, (2) dynamic allocation and de-allocation of one-dimensional arrays, (3) solve a problem using object-oriented programming. You will do so through the design of a program that parses circuit building commands from the standard input, displaying appropriate error messages if necessary, and by creating and maintaining resistors in a circuit. You will be asked to calculate the voltage at certain nodes. 
**Problem Statement**
Your task is to implement a program for storing resistors in a circuit. The circuit, or network, is defined by a number of nodes, each node being connected to one or more resistors. Each resistor has certain values associated with it, including: resistance value, text name, and the IDs of the two nodes (endpoints) it connects. The diagram below (Fig 1) illustrates an example. Here R1 connects nodes 1 and 2, R2 does the same, and R3 connects nodes 1 and 3. The nodes could be strips on a breadboard for example, with resistors plugged in to some nodes.
The program you will write is similar to the "input-and-store-the-network" portion of real programs used to simulate electric circuits, and programs that control the robots that automatically insert resistors connecting the appropriate points (nodes) on circuit boards.
