// This is the main function of the program. It should include the
// command parser functions for the various shapes. One example for
// the circle shape is given, which you should mimic for the other
// shapes

// The main fucntion does three key things
//      1. It creates a database for up to 1000 shapes and up to 10 shape types
//      2. It registers your command parser call-back functions with the database
//      3. It invokes the command parser method of the database
